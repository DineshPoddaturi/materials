# Working with date and time


## `lubridate` package

easy-to-use converter functions: 

* date: ymd, mdy, dmy, ...
* time: hm, hms, ...
* date & time: ymd_hms, mdy_hm, ...

lots of convenient extractor functions: year, month, week, wday, mday, yday, hour, minute, ...<br>
extractor functions can also be used for setting elements of date and time, e.g. `hour(x) <- 12`


## Example

```
summary(x)
y <- ymd(x)
summary(y)
```
