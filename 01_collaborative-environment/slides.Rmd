# Tools for collaborating in teams

## A test case

The dataset `brfss_iowa.csv` (linked from website) contains 6227 records from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for Iowans.

> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors.

It is conducted annually by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).


## Your turn

You are asked to investigate the relationship between height and weight of Iowans based on the 2015 BRFSS records (see course website for data).
(The variables `WEIGHT2` and `HEIGHT3` are collected during the interview)

In the next 20 mins:

1. Use your favorite software (IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE R!!!) to come up with a graphical summary of the relationship between weight and height (fix potential problems in the data!). 
2. Write a short report of your findings. 


## Your turn

In the next 10 mins:

1. Introduce yourself to your neighbor. 
2. Exchange reports - **BUT DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE DATA OR THE ANALYSIS** (yet)
3. Try to reproduce your neighbor's findings. 

# How did that go?

- Where did things get problematic?
