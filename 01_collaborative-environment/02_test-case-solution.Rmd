# Solution to the test case 

## A test case

The dataset `brfss_iowa.csv` (linked from website) contains 6227 records from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for Iowans.

> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors.

It is conducted annually by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Codebook with detailed explanations of variables is [available here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf).

## Our turn

We are asked to investigate the relationship between height and weight of Iowans based on the 2015 BRFSS records (see course website for data).
(The variables `WEIGHT2` and `HEIGHT3` are collected during the interview)

<br>

1. Navigate to https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials
2. Open the folder `01_collaborative-environment` and download the file `02_test-case-solution.Rmd`
3. Open the file in RStudio.
4. "Knit" the file.

## What is the relationship between height and weight? 

Read the data: 

```{r message = FALSE}
iowa <- readr::read_csv("https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/materials/raw/master/01_collaborative-environment/data/brfss_iowa.csv") 
# the read_csv function from the readr package is faster than the standard read.csv
# but the output is a tibble (we'll come back to that)
iowa
```

## Plot 

Load the `ggplot2` package to plot weight versus height:
```{r message = FALSE, fig.width=3.5, fig.height = 3.5, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
iowa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = WEIGHT2, y = HEIGHT3)) + geom_point()
```

## 
Now that picture comes a bit as a surprise! I would have thought that height and weight would show a somewhat positive correlation, but these clusters are strange.

Have a look at the [codebook](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/pdf/codebook15_llcp.pdf): HEIGHT3 and WEIGHT2 are the originally recorded variables.

## Next steps

Obviously, we need to spend some time cleaning this variable (and the weight variable, too) before we can make use of them. 

We have a couple of choices: 

(1) We can buckle down and do that clean-up and then move on to the graphical summary. 
(2) We can take another look at the variables and investigate what `HTIN4`, `HTM4`, and `WTKG3` are ... 

## Route 2

Let's take the second route first and draw a picture of height and weight in metric units:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 2.5}
iowa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = HTM4, y = WTKG3)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + facet_grid(.~SEX) +
  geom_smooth()
```

These charts look much better! We see a general increase in weight as height increases. The variability in weight is huge, though. On average, women (`SEX = 2`) are shorter and lighter.

## Route 1

This is a bit more work. Let's just take on height for now:

```{r}
# split the data into metric and standard:
metric <- iowa %>% filter(HEIGHT3 >= 9000)
standard <- iowa %>% filter(HEIGHT3 < 9000)

# transform all metric values by subtracting 9000
metric <- metric %>% mutate(
  height = HEIGHT3 - 9000,
  height = replace(height, height == 999, NA)
)

# extract feet and inch. calculate height from combining the two.
# height is variable converted from inch to centimeter
standard <- standard %>% mutate(
  height = replace(HEIGHT3, HEIGHT3 == 7777, NA),
  feet = height %/% 100,
  inch = height %% 100,
  height = feet *30.48 + 2.54*inch
) %>% select (-feet, -inch)

# get the data together again:
iowa <- rbind(metric, standard)
```

##

```{r}
# now plot
iowa %>% filter(!is.na(height)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5) +
  facet_grid(SEX~.)
```

We get similar findings - for height at least: women are on average shorter than men.

## Route 1 (cont'd.)

do the same thing for weight as we did for height before: 1 pound is 0.454 kg

```{r}
# split the data into metric and standard:
metric <- iowa %>% filter(WEIGHT2 >= 9000)
standard <- iowa %>% filter(WEIGHT2 < 9000)

# transform all metric values by subtracting 9000
metric <- metric %>% mutate(
  weight = WEIGHT2 - 9000,
  weight = replace(weight, weight == 999, NA)
)

# extract feet and inch. calculate height from combining the two.
# height is variable converted from inch to centimeter
standard <- standard %>% mutate(
  weight = replace(WEIGHT2, WEIGHT2 == 7777, NA),
  weight = weight*.454
) 

# get the data together again:
iowa <- rbind(metric, standard)
```

## Route 1, result

```{r warning = FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=3}
iowa %>% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  facet_grid(.~SEX) +
  geom_smooth()
```


## Overview of the different height variables

```{r}
summary(iowa[,c("HEIGHT3", "HTIN4", "HTM4", "height")])
```

Why are there more missing values in `HTIN4`?

##

```{r}
iowa %>% filter(is.na(HTIN4), !is.na(HTM4)) %>% select(HEIGHT3)
```

These seem to be metric values! Are any metric values  converted?

```{r}
summary(between(iowa$HEIGHT3, 9000, 9998))
```

No. The official BRFSS data is missing any metric data in the variable `HTIN4`!
