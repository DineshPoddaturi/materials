# Welcome to Data Technologies for Statistical Analysis

## Why Data Technologies?

Not all data ... 

- lives in spread sheets, 
- is nice and clean, 
- fits in a machine's main memory.

As statisticians we **cannot** always rely on other people and disciplines to get the data into a nice and tidy format.

## What are we going to do?

This course deals with concepts, skills, and tools related to 

- acquiring and combining data from different sources, 
- rearranging and summarising data,
- communicating methods and results in form of graphics, packages, and web applications.

... along the way ... make our process as transparent and reproducible as possible.

## Data comes in a lot of different formats

... as sound 
![](data/i-like-statistics_hh.mp3)

... as image
<img src="data/striations.jpg" width=150>

... in a monitoring device
<img src="data/fitbit.png" width=250>


## 

```{r}
library(tuneR)
ils_class <- readWave("data/i-like-statistics_hh.wav")
str(ils_class)
```

```{r, echo =FALSE, cache = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
ils_df <- data.frame(left=ils_class@left, right=ils_class@right)
ils_df$time <- 1:nrow(ils_df)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
ils_df %>% ggplot(aes(time, right)) + geom_line()
```

##

```{r}
library(jpeg)
img <- readJPEG("data/imgres.jpg")
str(img)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = TRUE, cache= TRUE, fig.width=9, fig.height=3}
img_df <- data.frame(expand.grid(y = 1:dim(img)[1], x = 1:dim(img)[2]))
img_df$red <- as.numeric(img[,,1])
img_df$green <- as.numeric(img[,,2])
img_df$blue <- as.numeric(img[,,3])
p1 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = red) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "red") + theme(legend.position="none")
p2 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = green) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "green")+ theme(legend.position="none")
p3 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = blue) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "blue")+ theme(legend.position="none")
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3, nrow=1)
```

... what kind of birds are [these](http://www.theradzoo.com/meet-the-animals/birds/rainbow-lorikeet/)?

## ... there's an R package for that!

answer almost independent from the question asked ... obvious advantages

disadvantages

- finding a needle in a haystack? - problem of riches: which is the best solution, is there a good solution?
- often a solution to a different problem - can we extend/append functionality? how?
- packages are of varying quality - we need to be able to assess code for its performance

... these are some of the problems we will be dealing with.

## Syllabus

Full syllabus is available [from the course website](syllabus.pdf).

###Textbook (optional)

- Hadley Wickham: *Advanced Programming in R*
- Paul Murrell: *Data Technologies in R*
- Yihui Xie: *Dynamic Documents with R and knitr*
- additional readings

Course website: 

- Materials, assignments, code: [https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/)
- Blackboard (for grades)



## Grades

| Component | Weight |
|:-- | --:|
| Reading & Blog | 15% |
| Labs | 40% |
| *Final Project* | |
|   report | 35% |
|   presentation | 10% |


## Labs

- during class time on every other Thursday (starting with Thursday, Jan 19th) 
- you will be partnered (randomly) in groups of 2 to 3
- lab assignments are designed to be finished during class time, but 'finishing touches' can be applied until the following Monday, 10pm. 
- if you cannot attend the lab, please let me know beforehand. Nevertheless, you are expected to do the work!

## Attendance

I expect you to attend class: there will be a substantial amount of time devoted to 'hands-on' examples on the computers. Make use of that time!

If you have to miss class, please 

(a) let me know ahead of time. 
(b) make sure to catch up with the material (e.g. have a designated note taker, talk to one of your team members, ... )
